Sprint 1:
    JavaScript Notes Notion Link:
    https://www.notion.so/JavaScript-Notes-ce8a82d942ad421297c5165417835ced

    Efforts:
    * speed working though codecademy JS lessons
    * still trying to understand React code stuff

Sprint 2:
    New Notion link to all my web notes:
        https://fate-snowdrop-547.notion.site/Web-Dev-Learning-e7dc038701304263a494893c488ce0f3
    Note: 
        HTML Notes and CSS Notes were both things I did over the summer.
    
    Efforts: 
    * Now 76% through free Codecademy JS tutorials
    * Found a pretty good tutorial on React to work on:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t=874s

Sprint 3:
    Notion link from before still is it:
        * started adding to my React notes
    
    Efforts:
        * Tried to open up a branch and try to create a main page and discovered
        * that I don't know squat.

        * Now I'm working on the React codecademy tutorial for a bit
        * and what I've been learning is in the notes.

Sprint 4:
    Efforts:
        * Did another section of the React tutorial on Codecademy
        * some of the figma vectors to appear on the page (though it looks a bit goofy)
        * got the CSS file to actually apply to the vector components

    Goals for Next Time:
        * guess and check my way to the components being in the right spot
        * try and figure out how adding other boxes would work so that I can understand
          and collab with team buddies
        * (Maybe) add more components and see how login might work

Sprint 5:
    Efforts: 
        * nothing much honestly, busy week with classes
        * investigated possibility of nav bar and smooth scrolling like I saw in other presentations
        * broke and then fixed my project directory (too much experminatation)
    
    Goals for Next Time:
        * same as last time, but I'd also like to see how to extend the page
